# Dotfiles

This repository contains my application configuration files, and some helper scripts.

Everything in this repository is for my **personal** use.

## Scripts

The [`install-pkgs.sh`](./install-pkgs.sh) script will install packages required for this config.

**Disclaimer:** The scripts will perform potentially destructive actions, so make sure you read
and them if you intend to use them.
