# Dotfiles

This repository contains my application configuration files, and some helper scripts.

**Disclaimer:** Everything in this repository is for my **personal** use. Also, the scripts could perform
potentially destructive actions, so be careful if you intend to use them.

## Scripts

The [`install-pkgs.sh`](./install-pkgs.sh) script will install packages required for this config.
